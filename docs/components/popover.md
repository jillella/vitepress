# Popover

## General Guidelines

### Usage

To display additional content or options related to a specific UI element, typically triggered by a user action like clicking or hovering.

### Visual Hierarchy

**Positioning:** Can be positioned relative to the triggering element (top, bottom, left, right).

**Overlay:** Does not typically obscure the entire page but focuses on the element.

### Behavior

Allow popovers to be dismissed by clicking outside or using a close button.

### Psychological Impact

**Contextual Relevance:** Popovers are contextually relevant, appearing near the element they are related to, which makes them less disruptive.

**User Choice:** They provide information or options without taking users away from their current task, supporting a smooth workflow.

**Exploration:** Popovers encourage exploration by revealing additional content or options only when needed.

### Examples

Dropdown menus, additional information, or actions related to a specific item.

## Format and Punctuation

- Use sentence case for popover titles and content.
- End complete sentences with a period.
- Use concise language to convey information clearly.
