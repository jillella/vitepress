# Foundations

The STUDS foundations are the core elements that form the basis of our design system. They ensure consistency and coherence across all Simpson Strong-Tie applications.

## Layout Grid

The STUDS layout grid system provides a flexible and consistent way to structure content across different screen sizes and devices.

### XS (Xtra Small): 4 columns

Our grid system is designed to be responsive and adaptable, ensuring that your layouts look great on any device. It provides a consistent structure for aligning content and components, making it easier to create harmonious and visually appealing interfaces.

When using the STUDS grid system, consider the following guidelines:

1. Use appropriate column sizes for different screen sizes to ensure optimal readability and usability.
